`ng-fullstack` is a yeoman generator that allows you to rapidly get started with prototyping web applications with the newest technologies available. It allows you to choose between a `client app`, a `server app` or a `fullstack app`. All of them simple to extend and powerful to use.

### Getting Started

If you already have Node/Go setup, all you have to do is run:

```shell
$ npm install -g generator-ng-fullstack
```

Or, if you want to run the latest (in development) version:

```shell
$ npm install -g generator-ng-fullstack@next
```

Then, to create a new app, simply run:

```shell
$ yo ng-fullstack
```

A few questions will be shown, make sure you answer them and, there you go! Now you have the [boilerplate app working](https://github.com/ericmdantas/generator-ng-fullstack/wiki/Getting-Started#result).

Since some parts of the stack might be new to you, the boilerplate app is a simple TodoApp using the best approaches, separations of concerns and responsabilities - so you can see how it all works together as well as study the chosen stack.
For more info, checkout the [Todo App](https://github.com/ericmdantas/generator-ng-fullstack/wiki/ToDo-Walkthrough) in the wiki.
